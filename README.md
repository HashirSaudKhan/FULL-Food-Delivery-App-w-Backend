# Flutter Food App with Backend

---

## 1. Introduction
This document details the development of a food delivery app built using Flutter, Firebase, MongoDB, and Express.js. The app idea is somewhat similar to Foodpanda, aiming to provide a seamless food ordering experience. However, our Unique Selling Point (USP) is charging a lower margin of 10-15% per order compared to Foodpanda's 20-30% commission, making it more appealing to restaurants and users alike.

## 2. App Overview
The app allows users to browse restaurants, view food items, place orders, and track them in real-time. The process includes:

- **User Authentication:** Login/Signup via Firebase.
- **Menu Display:** Data fetched using Express.js APIs from MongoDB Atlas.
- **Order Placement:** Firebase Firestore.

### App Workflow
1. User logs in using Firebase authentication.
2. Retrieves restaurant data via Express.js GET APIs.
3. Places a menu item (e.g., burgers, salads) via POST API calls to MongoDB Atlas.
4. Order slips are generated in Firebase Firestore.

## 3. Frontend Overview
The appâ€™s user interface is designed in Flutter, providing a user-friendly experience. Key features include:

- Login/Sign up screens.
- Restaurant and menu listings.
- Add orders through the cart page and select add-ons for orders.

## 4. Backend Architecture

### 4.1 Firebase Authentication
Firebase is used to manage user authentication securely. It supports email and password-based login, ensuring data security.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Simple integration with Flutter.
- Real-time user authentication updates.

### 4.2 Database for Menu Listing: MongoDB Atlas
MongoDB serves as the database for storing menu lists (e.g., burgers, salads, desserts, drinks, sides).

### 4.3 Database for Slip Generation: Firestore
Firebase Firestore is used to generate order slips and store order data.

### 4.4 API Development (Express.js)
APIs built with Express.js handle data exchange between the app and the backend.

## 5. System Flow
This section details the interaction between various components:

1. **Authentication:** User logs in using Firebase.
2. **Data Retrieval:** Express.js APIs fetch restaurant/menu data from MongoDB Atlas.
3. **Order Placement:** Order data is sent to firestore.
